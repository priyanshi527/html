This repository consists of two projects made with html css and javascript!!

The First one is a combination of some fun activities :-
   1) You enter the year of your birth and it tells the approximate number of days you have lived, it's a simple javascript implementation.
   2) Here you generate same object by clicking the button, again a basic concept of multiple function calling.
   3) This is the game of rock,paper and scissors implemented using if else conditions in JavaScript.
   4) Here the color of button changes to the color of yur choice, implemented using remove and add on a classlist of colors.
   5) This is a blackJack game. Let's first discuss how to play it:
         So you are playing against the bot each of you are given chances to open your cards and to win your scoce needs to be greater than the bot but less than equal to                  21. Now we have 3 buttons here , when you click the hit button your card comes in the playing area with a background sound , you can click hit button as many times as you          want but remember once the sum of numbers displayed on cards exceeds 21, it shows YOU BUST!! with a loosing tone. Once you have clicked the stand button it tells that              now your turn is over and you are on stand,you can't click the hit button after clicking on stand. Then bot shows up it's cards. If the sum of bots card is less than your          cards it shows you won with a winning sound, if it's equal it shows it's a tie and else it shows you lose. All the sound effects are quite interesting. Now whatever your          score is at the end of your round is updated in a table given below which has 3 columns won, lost or tie, it updates itself after each round. Then if you want to play              again you can click on deal to make one more deal. After multiple plays you will be able to see the stats of all the rounds in the table till you refresh the page. 
         
         Making this involved a lot of functions and conditions this part really made me use javascript to the fullest of my knowledge!!
         
         
The second one is a Portfolio telling a breif about me. This is made using very basics of HTML5 and CSS without any framework. I have elegantly designed it ,easy to read and understand with very little designing giving i a sober look.
